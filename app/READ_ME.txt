 * this application is developed basing on the context of Monster Super League(A mobile game).
 * this application achieves simply functionalies as follows:
 *       add gem and monster with image and details into database, 
 *       retrive data and gem&monster expo,
 *       calculate the game's information, 
 * user can only use pre-stored images&video(including in images of monster, images of gem, intro video)
 * for demonstrating purpose we pre-populated some date(6 monsters and 6 gems).
 *

** calculate the game's infomation: 
 * making the app capable of calculating the data by using monster's information(e.g. HP, attack, etc.) 
 * and gem's information(e.g. Hp additional rate, etc.). 
 * this app for now allows users to calculate two monsters' EHP (Effective Health Point) and max damage. 
 * one monster allows to have up to 3 gems(the gem is dispensable).

** add gem and monster: making the app possible to add gem or monster into database with pre-stored image for choosing,
 * and custom your own collections.
 * user can clear all the data by clicking on RELEASE ALL

** gem&monster expo: making the app possible to display the information of gem or monster.
 * achieved this functional by using pop-window.
